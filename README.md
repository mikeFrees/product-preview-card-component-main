## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Scss

### What I learned

In this challenge i focused only on writing Scss and understanding how it works. I tried not to get distracted with other stuff and tried my best to get a good grasp on this technology.

### Continued development

I am going to continue to study Scss an try to use bootsrap in my next challenge. I would also like to have a better file organization so i will try to find a logical way of structuring my folder.
